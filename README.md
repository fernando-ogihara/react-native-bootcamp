# REACT NATIVE BOOTCAMP 2021 - (For Beginners) 

This is a series video were we going to build a React Native app (frontend) for our Sport's App built on [the Mern Bootcamp.]('https://github.com/jeanrauwers/mern-course-bootcamp')

We will build a <strong>Sports Web App</strong> for creating sports events and the app will include:

* User registration and authentication (maybe add facebook/gmail login if the series becomes popular) 
* Hashing password for security 
* Session control
* CRUD operations (create, read, update and delete) using provided API
* Search for events using filters (Running, Cycling or Swimming) 
* Sign UP for event in order to participate
* Upload images to the S3 bucket
* Push notification using web sockets 

### Milestones of the project
